## ✨ What I Customized

Although the Problem Investigator agent is **prebuilt by ServiceNow**, I made targeted customizations to better align with specific ITSM workflows:

- 🛠️ Modified the skill responses in:
  - `Get details of problem`
  - `Collect relevant incident details for a problem`
- 🧭 Customized the **agent flow and prompts** to enhance clarity for end users

These updates helped improve the accuracy and readability of the agent’s analysis during real-world problem investigation scenarios.
